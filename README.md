## FileConverter Project ##

In this project, I applied the Abstract Factory, Singleton, Prototype, and Builder software design patterns. The FileConverterFactory is an abstract factory which can create families of FileReaders and FileBuilders. 

FileReader is an interface with a member variable of type string which stores the results of reading the file. The implementation of this interface I've provided, BasicFileReader, is a bit trivial. However, it's been written such that more advanced file readers can be implemented and used in the same way.
